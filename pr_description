This Pull Request adds some fixes to the CTD modules:

- When loading the conditions for a video, the `get_conditions_provider_for_video()` method looks for the __assemblies.pickle_ file instead of the __full.pickle_ file generated by the BU model. Indeed, the CTD inference pipeline requires assembled poses  as conditions.
- `CondProvider.load_conditions_pickle()` is fixed (the number of frames was computed incorrectly).
- The `FilterLowConfidencePoses` preprocessor stage (introduced in https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/2984) is fixed. When given a keypoints conditions numpy array with a dimension of length 0 (0 individuals for example) - the `FilterLowConfidencePoses` was crashing.
- The `create_video_with_all_detections()` is adapted (previously we assumed that if `data` contained a `"bboxes"` key - it also contained a `"bbox_scores"` key, which is not longer the case if a CTD model is used). A similar fix was introduced in https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/2990 to the `create_labeled_images()` method.
